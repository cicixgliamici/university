# Operations Research (Ricerca Operativa)

## [Introduction](pplx://action/followup)

Operations Research (OR) is a multidisciplinary field that uses advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions. It involves the use of mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and optimization techniques to solve complex problems in various fields such as business, engineering, economics, and more.

## [Key Concepts in Operations Research](pplx://action/followup)

### 1. [**Mathematical Programming**](pplx://action/followup)

- **[Linear Programming (LP)](pplx://action/followup):** A method used to optimize a linear objective function subject to linear constraints.
  - **[Simplex Algorithm](pplx://action/followup):** A popular algorithm for solving LP problems.
  - **[Duality Theory](pplx://action/followup):** Provides insights into the problem by analyzing its dual form.

- **[Integer Linear Programming (ILP)](pplx://action/followup):** An extension of LP where variables are restricted to integer values.
  - **[Branch-and-Bound Method](pplx://action/followup):** Used for solving ILP problems by exploring possible solutions systematically.

- **[Nonlinear Programming](pplx://action/followup):** Involves optimizing nonlinear functions subject to nonlinear constraints.
  - **[Gradient Methods](pplx://action/followup):** Techniques like gradient descent are used for finding optimal solutions.

### 2. [**Network Optimization**](pplx://action/followup)

- Deals with optimizing flows or paths within networks.
- Includes:
  - Shortest Path Problems
  - Minimum Spanning Tree Problems
  - Maximum Flow Problems

### 3. [**Dynamic Programming**](pplx://action/followup)

A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions.

### 4. [**Graph Theory**](pplx://action/followup)

Used extensively in OR for modeling relationships between objects or nodes.
- Includes concepts like matching on graphs and network flow algorithms.

### [Applications of Operations Research](pplx://action/followup)

OR is applied across various sectors:
- Supply Chain Management: Optimizing inventory levels and logistics operations.
- Financial Planning: Portfolio optimization and risk management.
- Healthcare: Resource allocation in hospitals and disease spread modeling.
- Transportation Systems: Route planning and traffic flow optimization.

## [Tools Used in Operations Research](pplx://action/followup)

Common tools include:
1. Software packages like CPLEX or Gurobi for solving large-scale optimization problems efficiently.
2. Excel Solver or similar spreadsheet tools for smaller-scale optimizations.
