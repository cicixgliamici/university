| **Array**                      | A contiguous block of memory that stores elements.

| **Linked List**                | Consists of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.                                                                                     | **Access:** O(n); **Insertion/Deletion:** O(1) (if position is known)    | Dynamic memory allocation, implementing queues and stacks, and when frequent insertions/deletions are needed.|
| **Stack**                      | A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure. Elements are added and removed from the same end (top).                                                                        | **Push/Pop/Top:** O(1)                                                 | Function call management, recursion, backtracking algorithms, and parsing expressions.                       |
| **Queue**                      | A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure. Elements are enqueued at the rear and dequeued from the front.                                                                 | **Enqueue/Dequeue:** O(1) average                                       | Task scheduling, buffering, breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs, and process management.                      |
| **Hash Table**                 | Stores key-value pairs using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets, which handles collisions via chaining or open addressing.             | **Average:** O(1) for search, insertion, deletion; **Worst-case:** O(n)  | Fast lookups, caching, dictionaries, and indexing in databases.                                               |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)**   | A hierarchical tree structure where each node has at most two children. The left subtree contains values less than the node, and the right subtree contains values greater than the node. | **Average:** O(log n) for search/insertion/deletion; **Worst-case:** O(n) (if unbalanced) | Sorted data retrieval, dynamic set operations, and performing range queries.                                  |
| **Heap**                       | A complete binary tree satisfying the heap property (min-heap or max-heap), where each parent node is ordered with respect to its children.                      | **Insertion/Deletion:** O(log n); **Access min/max:** O(1)              | Priority queues, scheduling tasks, heap sort, and real-time simulation systems.                               |
| **Graph**                      | A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Can be directed or undirected and represented via adjacency lists or matrices.                                         | **Traversal:** O(V + E) for BFS/DFS; varies for other algorithms       | Modeling networks, social connections, routing, dependency graphs, and many optimization problems.            |
| **Trie**                       | A tree-like structure used to store strings, where each node represents a character in a common prefix shared among keys.                                            | **Insertion/Lookup:** O(m), where m is the length of the key             | Autocomplete systems, spell checking, IP routing, and efficient prefix-based searches.                        |
| **Skip List**                  | A layered, probabilistic linked list that allows fast search by "skipping" through elements, functioning similarly to balanced trees.                                | **Average:** O(log n) for search/insertion/deletion; **Worst-case:** O(n) (rare) | In-memory databases, ordered associative arrays, and as an alternative to balanced tree structures.            |
| **Segment Tree**               | A binary tree used to store intervals or segments, enabling fast range queries and updates on an array.                                                               | **Query/Update:** O(log n)                                              | Range queries in arrays, interval processing, computational geometry, and scenarios needing efficient updates.  |
