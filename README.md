## Computer Architecture 2

This course provides advanced knowledge in computer architecture, focusing on high-performance systems. Topics covered include:

- **Instruction-Level Parallelism**: Blocking and non-blocking execution models.
- **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture**: Modern, streamlined instruction set for RISC systems.
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Cache, RAM, and advanced memory architectures.
- **Data-Level Parallelism**: Vector extensions and processing for large datasets.
- **Multi/Many-Core Systems**: Architectures with multiple processing units.
- **Architectural Extensions**: Security features and power management techniques.

These concepts build on foundational knowledge such as register-memory instruction sets, 5-stage RISC pipelines, and I/O management.

## Operating Systems 2

This course explores advanced topics in operating systems, including security, virtualization, and concurrency. Main topics include:

- **Protection and Security**: Security models, mechanisms, and trusted systems.
- **Virtualization**: Hardware virtualization, VMM, and cloud computing support.
- **Concurrent Programming**: Non-sequential processes, pthreads, and Go/Ada for interaction models.
- **Parallel Programming**: HPC architectures, MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA programming.
- **Distributed Systems**: Fault tolerance, logical clocks, and election algorithms.

## Programming Languages and Computational Models

This course bridges programming languages and computational models, with a strong emphasis on theory and practical experimentation. Key topics include:

- **Formal Language Theory**: Grammars, Chomsky classification, and syntax parsing.
- **Interpreter and Compiler Design**: Runtime systems and Java-based examples.
- **Functional Programming**: Recursion, Lambda calculus, and evaluation models.
- **Multi-Paradigm Programming**: Scala and Kotlin as multi-paradigm languages.
- **Dynamic Languages**: JavaScript as functional and prototype-based.
