# University Repository

This repository contains code and study materials related to **Computer Science and Engineering**, covering subjects from my studies in the Bachelor's program in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Milano and the Master's program in Computer Science and Engineering at Universit√† degli Studi di Bologna. It is designed to help students deepen their understanding of various topics by providing practical examples, exercises, and summaries of key concepts. Additionally, it includes other useful information for general computer science knowledge and education.

## Guides & Lookup Tables

[Here](Guides&LookupTables) you can find all the non-essential information from various courses, but extremely useful for anyone who wants to study computer science, especially more practical/useful information for entering the job market. The lookup tables are tables containing fundamental concepts, useful for quick reviews or to spark curiosity about new topics

- **Docker**
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Digital Documentation**: Markdown, LaTex

## Computer Architecture 2

[This course](ComputerArchitecture2) provides advanced knowledge in computer architecture, focusing on high-performance systems. Topics covered include:

- **Instruction-Level Parallelism**: Blocking and non-blocking execution models.
- **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture**: Modern, streamlined instruction set for RISC systems.
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Cache, RAM, and advanced memory architectures.
- **Data-Level Parallelism**: Vector extensions and processing for large datasets.
- **Multi/Many-Core Systems**: Architectures with multiple processing units.
- **Architectural Extensions**: Security features and power management techniques.

These concepts build on foundational knowledge such as register-memory instruction sets, 5-stage RISC pipelines, and I/O management.

## Operating Systems 2

[This course](OperatingSystems2) explores advanced topics in operating systems, including security, virtualization, and concurrency. Main topics include:

- **Protection and Security**: Security models, mechanisms, and trusted systems.
- **Virtualization**: Hardware virtualization, VMM, and cloud computing support.
- **Concurrent Programming**: Non-sequential processes, pthreads, and Go/Ada for interaction models.
- **Parallel Programming**: HPC architectures, MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA programming.
- **Distributed Systems**: Fault tolerance, logical clocks, and election algorithms.

## Programming Languages and Computational Models

[This course](ProgrammingLanguages&ComputationalModels) bridges programming languages and computational models, with a strong emphasis on theory and practical experimentation. Key topics include:

- **Formal Language Theory**: Grammars, Chomsky classification, and syntax parsing.
- **Interpreter and Compiler Design**: Runtime systems and Java-based examples.
- **Functional Programming**: Recursion, Lambda calculus, and evaluation models.
- **Multi-Paradigm Programming**: Scala and Kotlin as multi-paradigm languages.
- **Dynamic Languages**: JavaScript as functional and prototype-based.
