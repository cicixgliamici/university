## Extended Syntax and Advanced Features

### GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM)
- **Task Lists:** Create checklists using `[ ]` for unchecked items and `[x]` for completed tasks.
- **Tables:** Build tables using pipes (`|`) and dashes (`-`), making it easy to display structured data.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Use triple backticks followed by a language identifier to create code blocks with syntax highlighting.
- **Strikethrough:** Use the syntax `~~text~~` to strike through text, which is useful for indicating deletions or changes.

### Advanced Features for Technical and Academic Documents
- **Footnotes:** Some Markdown implementations support footnotes to add references or additional commentary without disrupting the main text.
- **Mathematical Expressions:** Integrate LaTeX-style math equations directly within your Markdown using tools like MathJax or KaTeX.
- **Definition Lists:** Create lists that associate terms with their definitions, ideal for glossaries or technical explanations.
- **Abbreviations:** Define abbreviations that are automatically expanded throughout the document, ensuring consistency in terminology.

### Tools and Converters
- **Pandoc:** A versatile document converter that can transform Markdown files into HTML, PDF, LaTeX, DOCX, and more. This makes it ideal for producing professional-quality, publishable documents.
